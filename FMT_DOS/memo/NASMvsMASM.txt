MASM
Pros
- Intel Official Format (I suppose).
- At least gives a line where error takes place.
Cons
- Need to run from DOS emulator.
- Sometimes secretly one-pass assemble (MACRO)



NASM
Pros
- Don't need a DOS emulator ->  Can streamline build to run.
- Usage of LOCAL labels are more stable.
- .LST file is much more readable than MASM
Cons
- Lines of errors and in which file error occured is meaningless.
- Open source but, will it last long?  Or will it suddenly disappear like other open-source projects?
